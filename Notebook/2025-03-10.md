## DAgger policy

$$
\pi = \beta \pi_E + (1 - \beta) \pi_L
$$

- Policy $\pi$, maps states to actions; $\pi(s, a)$
- Expert policy $\pi_E$, provided by the user; Expert demonstration
  - Has all state spaces (?)
- Learned policy $\pi_L$, through a neural net
- Data appended, over iterations
- Over time, $\beta: 1 \to 0$
  - Shifting to using learned policy only

- Covariance shift (?)

- Coffee example (?)
- Data imbalance
  - Using a weighted regression
