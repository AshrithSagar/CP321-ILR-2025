## Interfaces for demonstration

### Motion capture

#### Correspondance problem

- Human hand has 22-28 DOF
- Mapping them to a robot hand is a challenge
- There is no direct mapping
- Need to convert to a lower dimenional system to enable learning the main/simpified motions
- Especially for under actuated robotic hands, which is typical
- Types of grasp
  - Power grasp
  - Precision grasp

#### Synergy

- Reduce the number of independent variables to manage the joint variables
- Similar to a Principal component analysis (PCA) application
- $q^h \in \mathbb{R}^D$
- $y = A q$


### Kinesthetic teaching

- Teaching the robot directly from demonstration by a human; By holding hand
- Advantage:
  - No correspondance problem
- Disadvantage:
  - Bimanual
    - Need two hands, say, to teach the robotic hand

- Bimanual teleoperation

### Multi modal

- Map to a latent space
- Finding a cross model representation in latent space
- Latent space
  - A lower-dimensional representation
  - Variables capture the information, but don't mean anything specificly in the real world exactly
  - Also encountered in Autoencoders


## Data via optimal control

- Converting to a closed loop dynamical system
- $\dot x = J \dot \theta, \qquad \dot \theta = J^+ \dot x$

  - Mapping end-effector position and joint variables
  - $(.)^+$ is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse
- Trajectory planning
  - Given target position $x*$ and initial end-effector position $x(0)$

  - Find inital joint variables from the initial position, $q(0) = F^{-1}(x(0))$

  - Initialise time to zero, $t = 0$

  - Loop:
    - l=l

- Solutions to linear systems
  - $A x = b$, where $A_{m \times n}$
  - Case-1: $m < n$
    - More variables than equations
    - Infinite solutions

  - Case-2: $m > n$
    - More equations than variables
    - 0 or 1 solution

- Considerations for data
  - Amount
  - Quality
  - Generalisation
    - iid
    - Out-of-distribution
