## Gaussian process regression (GPR)

RBF kernel
$$
k(x_i, x_j) = a^2 \exp{ \left( -\frac{1}{2 l^2} {\Vert x_i - x_j \Vert}^2 \right) }
$$
GPR has a nice advantage that it takes into account the covariance to predict the mean. ~When far away from the mean, better not to predict than predict incorrectly. ~~To not know something, is also knowledgeful.
