\section*{Exercise 1.2}

Consider two variables \( x \) and \( y \) coupled with the following dynamics
\begin{align*}
     & \dot{x}=\beta x, \quad \beta \in R      \\
     & \dot{y}=-y+\alpha x, \quad \alpha \in R
\end{align*}
Answer the following:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Does this system have an equilibrium point? What is it?
    \item For what values of \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) is the system stable at the equilibrium point?
    \item For what values of \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) is the system unstable at the equilibrium point?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsubsection*{1. Equilibrium Point}

The equilibrium occurs when both \(\dot{x} = 0\) and \(\dot{y} = 0\).
From the system:
\[
    \dot{x} = \beta x = 0 \implies x = 0
\]
\[
    \dot{y} = -y + \alpha x = 0 \implies y = \alpha x \implies y = 0
\]
Therefore, the equilibrium point exists and is the point \( \boxed{ (0, 0) }\).
