# Assignment-1

Some hints for assignment 1

Exercise 1.1

1. The trajectories are cubic in time, not in Cartesian space.
The shape of the trajectory shown in Figure 1 may not be representative of the expected trajectory.

1. You may assume starting and ending velocities as zero.

Exercise 1.2

1. For part (a) the optimal time should be around 0.9349 seconds.

1. For part (b) the trajectory should be a straight line.
