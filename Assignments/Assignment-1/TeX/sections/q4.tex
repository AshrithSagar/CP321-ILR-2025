\subsubsection*{Question 1}

What is the effect of using different Jacobian inversion methods?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

The different Jacobian inversion methods have different convergence rates and stability properties.
The Pseudo Inverse method is more prone to singularities.

\subsubsection*{Question 2}

Can you think of other features that could be added to this algorithm?

\subsubsection*{Solution}

We can add a damping factor to the Jacobian to make the algorithm more stable.


\subsubsection*{(b) Optimal control}
