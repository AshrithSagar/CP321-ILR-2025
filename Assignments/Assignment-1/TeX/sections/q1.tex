\section*{Exercise 1.1}

\textbf{Closed Form Trajectory}

Given a cubic polynomial of the form \(f(t) = a_0 + a_1t + a_2t^2 + a_3t^3\), we can find the coefficients \(a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3\) by solving the following system of equations, which is a set of 4 equations with 4 unknowns:
\begin{align*}
    f(0)    & = a_0 = 0                                   \\
    f(T_f)  & = a_0 + a_1 T_f + a_2 T_f^2 + a_3 T_f^3 = 1 \\
    f'(0)   & = a_1 = 0                                   \\
    f'(T_f) & = a_1 + 2 a_2 T_f + 3 a_3 T_f^2 = 0
\end{align*}
where \(T_f\) is the time taken to reach the goal state.
We need to setup these equations for each of the coordinates \(x, y, z\), and solve them.
