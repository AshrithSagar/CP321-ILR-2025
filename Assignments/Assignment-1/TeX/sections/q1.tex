\section*{Exercise 1.1}
Closed Form Trajectory

Given a cubic polynomial of the form \(f(t) = a_0 + a_1t + a_2t^2 + a_3t^3\), we can find the coefficients \(a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3\) by solving the following system of equations:
\begin{align*}
    f(0)  & = a_0 = 0                          \\
    f(T)  & = a_0 + a_1T + a_2T^2 + a_3T^3 = 1 \\
    f'(0) & = a_1 = 0                          \\
    f'(T) & = a_1 + 2a_2T + 3a_3T^2 = 0
\end{align*}
where \(T\) is the time taken to reach the goal state.
We need to setup these equations for each of the coordinates \(x, y, z\), and solve them.
